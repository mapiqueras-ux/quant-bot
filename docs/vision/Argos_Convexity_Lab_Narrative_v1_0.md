# Argos Quant
## From Trading System to Convexity Research Lab

Version: v1.0
Status: Conceptual Vision Document
Scope: Strategic Narrative / Research Philosophy

# 1. Strategic Reframe

Argos Quant is not designed to be a trading bot.

Argos is designed to be a **structured research laboratory for applied convexity in financial markets**.

The objective is not to:

- Maximize trade frequency
- Optimize short-term backtest metrics
- Compete on raw predictive accuracy

The objective is to:

- Detect structural inefficiencies
- Validate convex payoff asymmetries
- Measure statistical stability
- Scale only persistent, regime-aware structures

---

# 2. Foundational Hypothesis

Financial markets are competitive and largely efficient.

However, local structural inefficiencies emerge temporarily due to:

- Liquidity imbalances
- Volatility regime transitions
- Orderflow displacement
- Behavioral clustering
- Institutional execution constraints

These inefficiencies are:

- Contextual
- Regime-dependent
- Time-variant
- Often convex in payoff distribution

Argos is built to systematically detect, interrogate, and validate these convex structures.

---

# 3. Redefining Edge

Most retail systems optimize:

> Win rate.

Most fragile systems optimize:

> Backtest metrics.

Argos optimizes:

> Structural convexity + stability across regime variation.

This reframes the central research question from:

“Does this system win often?”

to:

“Does this system produce asymmetric payoff distributions that survive Monte Carlo stress, walk-forward validation, and regime segmentation?”

This difference is structural, not cosmetic.

---

# 4. Architecture as Intellectual Property

The core IP of Argos is not a parameter configuration.

It is the layered research architecture:

- FSM-based structural detection
- Full trade-event logging
- Conservative execution modeling
- Ablation testing framework
- Regime segmentation
- Edge Stability Monitoring
- Distribution shift detection
- Walk-forward validation

Each strategy is treated not as a finished product, but as a hypothesis subjected to structured statistical interrogation.

The process is the asset.

---

# 5. Convexity as Design Principle

Convex systems:

- Lose small
- Win large
- Survive noise
- Benefit from volatility expansion

Rather than predicting direction, Argos focuses on:

- Capturing expansion following structural displacement
- Participating in liquidity-driven transitions
- Avoiding overexposure during compression regimes
- Preserving asymmetric payoff structures

This is closer to optionality engineering than directional forecasting.

---

# 6. Research Governance

Argos is built around research discipline:

- No premature parameter optimization
- Evidence-gated infrastructure scaling
- Clear separation between Research and Production
- Version-controlled hypothesis testing
- Structured ablation before expansion

Edge discovery is treated as a scientific process, not as discretionary experimentation.

---

# 7. Evolution Path

If S1 validates structural edge:

Argos evolves into a platform capable of:

- Multi-strategy convex portfolio construction
- Regime-adaptive capital allocation
- Automated edge decay detection
- Hybrid Pine + Python research acceleration
- Scalable statistical experimentation

At that stage, Argos is no longer:

> A strategy.

It becomes:

> A convexity research engine.

---

# 8. Differentiation

Many quantitative systems attempt to predict.

Few focus on:

- Structural convexity
- Stability under regime variation
- Research governance discipline
- Evidence-gated scaling

The differentiation of Argos lies not in complexity, but in methodological rigor and statistical humility.

---

# 9. Investor-Grade Thesis (Conditional)

If and only if statistical edge is validated:

Argos is not positioned as a signal generator.

It is positioned as:

> A systematic engine for detecting, validating, and scaling convex trading structures.

Scalability does not rely on a single model.

It relies on the capacity to repeatedly identify and validate structural asymmetries.

That is the long-term intellectual thesis.

---

# 10. Final Principle

Edge first.
Infrastructure second.
Narrative last.

The narrative only has value if supported by statistically demonstrated asymmetry.

Until then, Argos remains a laboratory in disciplined discovery.
